One, men; one, gods; of one <br>
mother both breathe. Power,
distinguished, divides them:
so negligible one is, the other, 
bronzed, infallible, heaven
stands forever home. Still, 
somewhat, we meet, in the great
mind or nature godlike, though,
day-light, know not, nor night,
what track fate wrote us run.

Alcimidas today declares
with the land’s yields visible
kinship: those, changing, give
from the field men their living,
abundant, at one time, another
regaining strength in repose. So
he came, out of Nemeas’ games
lovely, an athletic boy; and this
pursuing, his godsent ordinance,
showed himself, not ungifted,
a hunter in the ring, in the footprint
of Praxidamas planting his foot,
Grandfather of his bloodline. He,
Olympian, first brought Aeacidae
Alpheus’ wreath, won five crowns
at the Isthmus, thrice Nemea, ended
the lapse of Socleides
