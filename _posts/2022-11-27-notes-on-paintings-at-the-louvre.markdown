Rosso Fiorentino, Pieta and The Challenge of the Pierides. In the former, expressive, almost random colouring, more concerned with rhythm and pattern than theme and structure. Some of this carries over into the smaller former, and I admire the thick (not defuse) vagueness of the figures. 


Bartolommeo: small features on faces, an overal lightness except on clothing, which is thick and silken.


Giulio Romano's Circumcision: dark, Tintoresque colouring, though clearer in delineation. Grey skin. Twisted columnation probably to give the impression of the oriental. 


Pontormo, The Virgin and Child with Saint Anne and Four Saints: unusual colouring (I have no name for the blue-green which replaces the blue or the red replacing the Virgin's purple or pink) and enlongated swanish figures.


Parmagianino, The Mystic Marriage of Saint Catherine: the figures sit on the background like a softened photonegative, white-yellow-grey with the exception of the Virgin's purple.


Barocci, Circumcision: Grey and pink-grey (on skin), matte dark blue of the Virgin's cloak; a softness without vagueness of line and colourful figure set in Venetian darkness; faces of concern and adoration except the Christ child who stares out with the look of invitation typical of friendly babies.


Murillo, Birth of the Virgin: a play of soft dark and soft light, obliquely mounting; pale yellow, pale red, pale beige, pale greying-pink of warm expression, growing from the quiet half-dark of the mother's birthbed. At a distance, the first row of figures, consisting of dog, cherub, babe, nurse, nurse yellow, and nurse green, is more thickly presenced than their aethereal back-figures. The ends of the hypotenuse converge towards the child. 


Goya, Mariage in√©gal: small thick-sketchlikeness, typical of Goya, textured rather than edged, as the texture is the true edge of the surface; indefinite, but never vague. Typical brown-gold scratched with whiteness as glare, as in the woman's vale, and the monks robe beneath his vestments. Matte-grey surface otherwise.


Ribera, Deposition of Christ: stark shadow and measured light, boldest on the shoulder shouldering the Christ's half-darkened head; mirrored perpendicular in shape and shadowing the man clasping his hands above his hand above him. This pallor contrasted in the warm and textured faces of the men on left (grey cloaked) and right (red cloaked). (Overwrought)
