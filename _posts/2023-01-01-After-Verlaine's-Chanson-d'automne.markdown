The prolonged bawl <br>
of the fall <br>
violinâ€™s <br>
boredom <br>
breaks my humdrum <br>
heart in. <br>

Wheezing and white  <br>
at the strike  <br>
of the clock  <br>
the mind strays  <br>
on bygone days <br>
in shock. <br>

I am let go <br>
on the tow <br>
of the gusts <br>
which bear <br>
here and there <br>
my leafdust. <br>
