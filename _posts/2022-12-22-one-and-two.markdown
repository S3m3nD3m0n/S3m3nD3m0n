Plato acknowledged the equality of the one and the two as the difference between difference and indifference. This is lost in the later Platonism, but explains the proclivity of his middle followers for skepticism. Probably this is best understood with reference to the sudden (ἐξαίφνης) of the Parmenides. 

The two differentiates the one and the two. The one indifferentiates the two and the one. This standing movement of contraction and repulsion is the sudden. It is not simply that difference takes precedence over the same; rather, they preside over each other.

Not indecision, but decision pure and simple: the skeptic takes the equal weighing of assertions as the poles between which he suspends his judgement. I want to say something differentiates Plato's thought from this.

The ends of his aporia, which as the result of dialectic are not arbitrary but essential, do not suspend judgement, but suggests an exchange (μεταβολή) at work between first principles and, to the extent that such is possible, in itself. "To the extent that such is possible" because the exchange is not itself among the exchanged, and is not a third term. The being of exchange is a selving rather than a self.
