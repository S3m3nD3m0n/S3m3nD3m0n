“I think therefore I am” means: if nothing else is, it is, and I am at least it; or, the being of thought is already the garauntee of a certain externality, however interior. Less succintly: thought is; I think; I am. Returning to the first: The thought which thinks it is, is, and I am, at least, that thought. What is established is the certainity of being in thought.

"I think therefore I am" — The self-being of thought is the self-being of the thinker. What is, on the one hand, the most immediately certain thing, must, on the other, be demonstrated; is, indeed needs must be, a self-demonstration. Therefore, what is given is that the given be proven, and that secondary demonstrate itself as primary.
