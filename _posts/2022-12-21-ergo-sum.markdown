“I think therefore I am” means: if nothing else is, it is, and I am at least it; or, the being of thought is already the garauntee of a certain externality, however interior. Less succintly: thought is; I think; I am. Returning to the first: The thought which thinks it is, is, and I am, at least, that thought. What is established is the certainity of being.
