“I think therefore I am” means: if nothing else is, it is, and I am at least it; or, the being of thought is already the garauntee of a certain externality, however interior. Less succintly: I think; thought is; I am. Returning to the first: The thought which thinks it is, is, and I am, at least, that thought. What is taken for granted is the certainity of being in thought.

"I think therefore I am" — The self-being of thought is the self-being of the thinker. What is, on the one hand, the most immediately certain thing, must, on the other, be demonstrated; is, indeed needs must be, a self-demonstration. Therefore, what is given is that the given be proven, and that secondary demonstrate itself as primary.

We might assume that anything which need, or indeed does, prove itself primary, is not in fact so; and what preceeds demonstration, even self-demonstration, cannot itself be demonstrated. The certainity of being in thought is probably granted rather then proven, or granted within the proof. The appeal to God is therefore necessary.
