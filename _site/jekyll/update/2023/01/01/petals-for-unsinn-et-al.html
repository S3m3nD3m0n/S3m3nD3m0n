    <p>The only justification of work is to prove that no such justification is necessary. The effect is love.</p>

<p>Beauty, which is a definite effect despite its featurings, like all loves is singular and of one singular, unjustifiably real, lost to distraction. It concludes everything which is not itself.</p>

<p>The poet creates words for which words are insufficient.</p>

<p>Like all things sufficient to themselves, the conclusion of the poem encourages what it refuses, what is more than enough.</p>

<p>On lovers and commentators: beauty appears in the features of things, but not as them, and is confused for them only by the desperate or garrulous.</p>

<p>We realize, in the accomplished work, the world’s willingness to be.</p>

<p>The good may be both an aberation and the ultimate rule.</p>

<p>“Art” is now more excuse than fact.</p>

<p>Imagination, being weaker in fact and stronger in range than fact, knows more intimately the nothing which threatens all fact with illusion.</p>

<p>The work proves reality intensity; thus fiction outworks nature by its nature.</p>

<p>“Naturalism” has never not deceived from impotence.</p>

<p>Nothing seperates the mere act from action but itself.</p>

<p>To charge language with the force of what it names is the responsiblity of diction.</p>

<p>In winter appears only the hard edge of things.</p>

<p>Illusion is the least philosphic of dismissals.</p>

<p>Beauty is where the real begins to abstract itself.</p>

<p>The effect of an ordinary person today is as jarring againtst a city like Venice as the same in nature. We used to, and still do in translated forms, speak of nature and culture; and the old culture has become new nature as it fosilized.</p>
