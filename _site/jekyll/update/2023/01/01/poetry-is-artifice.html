<meta name="description" content="Poetry is artifice; the question of quality is whether the nature involved in that artifice holds up as nature, i.e. holds up out of the nature of its parts or merely by outward force. “Formalism,”as perjorative, means: composition held together by extrinsic force. “Form,” as compliment, means: composition held together by intrinsic force, as ρυθμός, meaning: not “flow” but composure. Or: “formalism” means posture, “form” composure. Moreover, there is a composure, and hence rhythm, not just of sound, but also of sense. From this it follows that the poet has his proximity to music not as a second-rate soundsmith with the misfortune of being corrupted by the word, but as a composer, in his own right, as is understood by the word “poet” (ποιητής). Our distance from the Greeks is measured by who merits the name “composer.”" />
