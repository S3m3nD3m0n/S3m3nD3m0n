    <p>Botticelli paints the Virgin’a face more droplike and thus less round, more gentle, declining, and intimate than Lippi, who prefers a certain stateliness. There is also less of the erotic (in Lippi).</p>

<p>The faces of Saint Anne, the Virgin Mary, and the Infant Jesus are distinctly Leonardan: long lips, long eyes, cheeks dimpling into the chin, gently shaded into the curves and crevices. Hue and shading of skin are also typically sensitive, whereas the clothing, especially the robe of the Virgin’, is deep pastel, but not dry, and vibrant like stone. There is perhaps no better painter of gentle inclination.</p>

<p>The Pastoral Concert, if not itself Giorgione’s, is at least Titian at his most Giorgionesque. Things in concert have not yet been left behind for drama, as we see in the landscape, not quite that of the Venus, which is plainly structural, but nevertheless as crossed and overlapping, a genuine “setting.” This sense of landscape has been transformed by The Virgin and Child with Saint Catherine; the landscape is now a background. Here things are harmonized by the needs of dramatic emphasis, not their setting in space. This dramatic harmony is characteristic of the vague, dry, autumnal violence of the late paintings.</p>

<p>Maître de la répudiation d’agar, La Portement de Croix: the sense of smooth, deep colour moulding and patterning form, wet. The love of hue and formal distinction in complex arrangement. (Oil on panel).</p>

<p>Vermeer’s Lacemaker: A precision of colour, muted (but not weak), soft (but not indefinite) insists on every detail of the whole, as a whole. Moreover, what would, in other painters, be darkness are here shades of light, as the flesh-grey of the woman’s face or the delicate fingers. The edge of the hair glows with a concentrated precision, as lesser light. The lit edge is starker against the wall. It is the painting of the hands it paints, and realizes the concentration of the concentration it represents.</p>
