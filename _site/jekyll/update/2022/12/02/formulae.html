    <p>Formulae, as distinct from genre, exclude excellence. Genius, or ingenuinity, is responsible to problems of its form, deeply felt as need. Where no such need is felt, whether expressed through convention or innovation, the formulaic and programmatic remain the rule, and form and content arbitrary.</p>

<p>The formulaic relation to the past is also arbitrary; it responds to no present need, but is available for resortment at will. Time and place contract before a single vantage, itself  timeless and placeless, which for that reason appears in complete transparency. It is necessarily parodic, and unawares verges on farce.</p>
