    <p>“I think therefore I am” means: if nothing else is, it is, and I am at least it; or, the being of thought is already the garauntee of a certain externality, however interior. Less succintly: I think; thought is; I am. Returning to the first: The thought which thinks it is, is, and I am, at least, that thought. What is taken for granted is the certainity of being in thought.</p>

<p>“I think therefore I am” — The self-being of thought is the self-being of the thinker. What is, on the one hand, the most immediately certain thing, must, on the other, be demonstrated; is, indeed needs must be, a self-demonstration. Therefore, what is given is that the given proves itself, and that the secondary demonstrates itself as primary.</p>

<p>We might assume that anything which need, or indeed does, prove itself primary, is not in fact so; and what preceeds demonstration, even self-demonstration, cannot itself be demonstrated. The certainity of being in thought is probably granted rather than proven, or granted within the proof. The appeal to God is therefore necessary.</p>
