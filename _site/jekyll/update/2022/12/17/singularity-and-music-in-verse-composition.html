What is extraneous within the composition is unnecessary, and as such could be otherwise, where the accomplished work can only be exactly as it is. It is in this way that compression and the resistance to paraphrase go together. Any composition that could be adequately paraphrased, whose value lies in its theme or subject, has no necessary relation to its form. The very fact of content, be it thematic or otherwise, seems to open the composition to arbitrariness. Against this possibility a temptation appears: the condition of music, which has never ceased to accompany verse if not always in fact then certainly by implication; a unity of form and content, or at least an image of their indifference. Verse is, if anything, a pure use of language. The paradise of music, the silencing of communication and of content, may be inscribed within it, as perfection imperfection. The cost of such perfection, however, is the end of language, which can speak only so long as there is room to do so, that is, so long as it is not wholly suffocated by music. Hence, the integrity of verse composition, if we can suppose there is such a thing, cannot be admitted solely of the musical element, however essential. Integrity, in the only sense which a pure use of language can admit, means the skillful management of approximation. The composition is a composition of language insofar as it is only almost music, almost singular, almost necessary, almost self-contained, and speaks against its innermost aspiration.

The result will be almost as incommunicable as it is music, and as singular as the word allows without falling into silence." />

The value of compression, of simplicity or clarity, is the singularity of the composition.

<p>ยง2 
The integrity of the work, its composure, is an inner resistance to an inner exteriority. Its compromise is either weakness or posture. The former means dissolution, subsumption into mere externality. The latter mobilizes an exterior compulsion to hold together what would otherwise dissolve.</p>

<p>ยง3
The tension which all acheived verse must withstand is the composition of a singular form out of common matter.</p>
